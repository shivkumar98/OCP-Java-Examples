# üß† 9.4 Presenting the New Stream Methods
* Java 8 provides you methods for performing complex operations like searching for a file in a directory tree with one-line code which prior to Java 8 would've needed entire classes!

## üü• 9.4.1 Conceptualizing Directory Walking
* Files and directories can be represented as a tree, where every file/directory has exactly one parent directory
* A common task is to iterate across all files.
* Walking or traversing a directory is the process by which you start at a parent directory and iterating over all descendants until some condition is met
### ‚≠ê Selecting a Search Strategy ‚≠ê
* Depth-first search goes all the way through an arbritary leaf and navigates back to the root and then traversing down fully any skipped directories
* Breadth first search starts at the roor and processes all elements of each particular depth
* The Streams API employs the depth-first strategy with a max value of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`
<br>

## üü• 9.4.2 Walking a Directory
* Files.walk(path) returns a `Stream<Path>` which traverse the directory in a depth first and lazy manner
* By lazy it means the set of elements is built and read while the directory is being traversed
* Here is an example of walking of using a stream to walk a directory structure:
```java
try {
    Files.walk(path)
        .filter(p->p.toString().endsWith(".java"))
        .forEach(System.out::println);
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle file IO exception
}
```
* There is an overloaded method of walk `walk(Path,int)` which takes a maximum directory depth. E.g. you would specify an int of 1 if you wanted to print any child records

* By default, the `walk()` method will not traverse symbolic links

## üü• 9.4.3 Searching a Directory
* We used a stream filter to filter the results of the directory walk. `Files.find(Path,int,BiPredicate)` method. The BiPredicate takes Path and BasicFileAttributes as parameters.
* Here is an example:
```java
Path path = Paths.get("/bigcats");
long dateFilter = 14200700000l;
try {
    Stream<Path> stream = Files.find(path, 10,
        (p,a)->p.toString().endsWith(".java")
        && a.lastModifiedTime.toMillis()>dateFilter);
    stream.forEach(Exception e) {
        // handle file i/o exception
    }
}
```

## üü• 9.4.4 Listing Directory Content
* The File class has a `listFiles()` which represents the contents of the directory provided.
* Here is an example program which prints the contents of a `/zoo` directory:
```java
try {
    Path path = Paths.get("ducks");
    Files.list(path)
        .filter(p->!Files.isDirectory(p))
        .map(p -> p.toAbsolutePath())
        .forEach(System.out::println);
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle file io exception
}
```
* The output of this program will look something like:
```
/zoo/ducks/food.txt
/zoo/ducks/food-backup.txt
/zoo/ducks/weight.txt
```
## üü• 9.4.5 Printing File Contents
* We saw `Files.readAllLines()` and commented that it could result to an `OutOfMemoryError` problem
* The `Files.lines(Path)` does not suffer the same issue
* The contents of the file are read and processed lazily
* Here is an example:
```java
Path path = Paths.get("/fish/sharks.log");
try {
    Files.lines(path).forEach(System.out::println);
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle file IO exception
}
```
* Here is another program:
```java
Path path = Paths.get("/fish/sharks.log");
try {
    System.out.println(Files.lines(path)
        .filter(s->s.startsWith("WARN "))
        .map(s->s.substring(5))
        .collect(Collectors.toList()));
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle file I/O exception
}
```
