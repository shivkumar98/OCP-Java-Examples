# ðŸ§  9.1 Introducing NIO.2
* The first version of file I/O operations availabble in java was `java.io` API which was discussed in chapter 8
* The `java.io` API uses byte streams to interact with file data 
* Java then introduced NIO which stands for non-blocking IO
* NIO uses concepts of buffers and channels rather than java.io.streams
* Data from a file is placed in a temporary buffer which can be read forwards and backwards and NOT block the underlying resource
* Java 7 introduced NIO.2 API which was intended to be a replacement for `java.io.File`


## ðŸŸ¥ 9.1.1 Introducing Path
* The `java.nio.file.Path` interface is the main entry point for working with this new API!
* A `Path` obbject represents a hierarchial path on the storage system
* This acts as a direct replacement for `java.io.File` class
* Unlike the File class, the Path interface has support for symbolic linkks
* We can get an instance of Path using the `Paths` factory class
