/* What is a Local Inner Class?
 * A: This is a nested inner class defined within a method.
 * Similar to local variables, nested inner classes can go out of scope
 * 
 * Local Inner Classes have the following properties:
 * 1) They have no access modifier specified
 * 2) Can NOT be labelled static and can NOT contain static members
 * 3) They have acces to all members within enclosed class
 * 4) Can not access local variables of a method unless they are final
