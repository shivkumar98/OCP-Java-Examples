# üß† 6.4 Using Try-With-Resources

## üü• 6.4.1 Introduction

* Multi-catch helps reduce code duplication, however we can still have problems with duplication in `finally` clause.
* A resource is typically a file or database, and should be closed after it is used.
<br>
* Suppose you write a method, which reads first line of one file and write it to another file.
    - Before Java 7, this method would look like:

```java
public void oldApproach(Path p1, Path p2) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader in = null;
    BufferedWriter out = null;
    try {
        in = Files.newBufferedReader(p1);
        out = Files.newBufferedWriter(p2);
        out.write(in.readLine());
    } finally {
        if (in != null) in.close();
        if (out !=null) out.close();
    }
}
```
- This code is lengthy and doesn't handle any exceptions!üò¢
- If we use `try-with-resources` we can make the above code cleaner:

```java
public void newApproach(Path p1, Path p2) {
    try (BufferedReader in = Files.newBufferedReader(p1);
         BufferedWriter out = Files.newBufferedWriter(p2);) {
            out.write(in.readLine());
         }
}
```

- The `try-with-resources` closes AUTOMATICALLY CLOSES REWSOURCES.
- This feature is called *automatic resource management*

## üü• 6.4.2 Try-With-Resources Basics
* The `try-with-resources` statement does not contain an explicit finally block‚ùó
* Here are some basic syntaxes:

```java
try (BufferedReader r = Files.newBufferedReader(p1);
     BufferedWriter w = Files.newBufferedWriter(p2)) {
    // protected code
} // RESOURCES CLOSE HERE
```

```java
try (BufferedReader r = Files.newBufferedReader(p1);
     BufferedWriter w = Files.newBufferedWriter(p2)) {
    // protected code
} catch (IOException e) {
    // exception handler
} finally {
    // finally block
}
```

* The implicit finally runs before any catch or finnaly blocks.
* Can you see why the following does not compile‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```java
try (Scanner s = new Scanner; s.nextLine()) {
    s.nextLine();
} catch (Exception e) {
    s.nextInt(); // COMPILER ERROR
} finall {
    s.nextInt(); // COMPILER ERROR
}
```
* The issue is that the Scanner has gone out of scope at the end of the try clause.

## üü• 6.4.3 AutoCloseable
* Only resources which can be closed can be put in the try-with-resources statement!‚ö†Ô∏è
* E.g. the following does not compile‚ùå
```java
public class Turkey {
     public static void main() {
        try (Turkery t = new Turkey()) { // COMPILER ERROR

        }
     }
}
```
* The compiler will give the following error: `The resource type Turke does not implement java.lang.AutoCloseable`
* We can rectify this by implementing the `AutoCloseable` interface which has the method `public void close() throws Exception;`:
```java
public class TurkeyCage implements AutoCloseable {
    public void close() {
        System.out.print("close gate");
    }
}
```
<br>

* If you decide to throw a Checked Exception in your implementation, you must declare it in your method as with regular exceptions:

```java
public class Turkey implements AutoCloseable {
    public void close() throw Exception {
        throw new Exception("Cage is stuck");
    }

    public static void main() {
        try (Turkey t = new Turker()) { // COMPILER ERROR

        }
    }
}
```

* Java recommends that the `close()` implementation does not actually throw `Exception` but a more specific Exception so that the method can be called with unknown side-effects.


### üü° AutoCloseable vs Closeable
* AutoCloseable was introduced in Java 7. Closeable was another interface which existed before 7 and differed in the following ways
    - Closeable restricts the exception thrown to IOException
    - Required to be idempotent
* AutoCloseable is less strict than Closeableüí°
