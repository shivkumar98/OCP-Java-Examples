### 🎯 Exam Objectives 🎯

* Create worker threads using Runnable, Callable,, and use an ExecutorService to concurrently execute tasks.
* Identify potential threading problems among deadlock, starvation, livelock and race conditions
* Use synchronized keyword and `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package to control the order of thread execution
* Use `java.util.concurrent` collections and classes including CyclicBarrier and CopyOnWriteArrayList
* Use parallel Fork/Join Framework
* Use parallel Streams including reduction, decomposition, merging processes, pipelines, and performance
