# üñ®Ô∏è Chapter 8 - IO - Revision Notes ‚úçÔ∏è

## üü• 8.1 Files and Directories
* You can instantiate a file using either a String representing the location or using another File instance which is the parent directory
```java
File parent = new File("/home/smith");
File child = new File(parent, "data/zoo.txt");
```

* We have methods to make directories, confirm existence, delete, rename and list files.
* We do NOT have methods to MOVE/COPY

* Here are the **methods available to File class**:
```java
boolean exists();
String getName(); // gets the name of file or directory. E.g. zoo.txt
boolean isDirectory();
boolean isFile();
boolean delete(); // deletes file OR directory if empty
boolean renameTo(File file);
boolean mkdir(File directoryFile); // makes directory file denoted by file
boolean mkdirs(File file); // makes directory AND file even for dirs which don't exist
String getParent(); // returns absolute filepath of parent directory
File[] listFiles(); // returns a File[] denoting files in directory
long lastModified(); // returns no. of ms since the epoch the file was last modified
```

## üü• 8.2 Streams
### üü° Input/Output Stream Vs Reader/Writer
* There **four abstract classes** in java.io:
1) `Reader` üìñ
2) `Writer` ‚úçÔ∏è
3) `InputStream` üëâ0Ô∏è‚É£
4) `OutputStream` 1Ô∏è‚É£üëâ

* These classes can be divided into two types
1) Classes which have `InputStream`/`OutputStream` in their name
- Used for reading/writing **BINARY DATA**
2) Classes which have `Reader`/`Writer` in their name
- Used for reading/writing **CHARACTER/STRING DATA**

### üü° Low-Level Streams
* LOW LEVEL streams connect directly to source of data

| Class 			| Description 								|
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| FileInputStream   | This is an `InputStream` and reads binary data from file				|
| FileOutputStream  | This is an `OutputStream` and writes binary data to file				|
| FileReader        | This is a `Reader` and reads character data from file		    |
| FileWriter		| This is a `Writer` and writes character data from file 			|

* HIGH LEVEL streams are used to wrap another stream (the final 2 are not in the exam)
  
| Class 			| Description 								|
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| BufferedReader |  This is a `Reader` and takes in a low level `FileReader` |
| BufferedWriter | This is a `Writer` and takes in a low level stream `FileWriter` |
| BufferedInputStream | This is a `InputStream` which takes a low level `FileInputStream` |
| BufferedOutputStream |  This is a `OutputStream` which takes a low level `FileOutputStream` |
| ObjectInputStream | This deserializer is an `InputStream` and takes either `FileInputStream` OR `BufferedInputStream` |
| ObjectOutputStream | This serializer is an `OutputStream` and takes either `FileOutputStream` OR `BufferedOutputStream` |
| PrintStream  | This is a `OutputStream` which gives useful methods for writing and formatting data  |
| PrintWriter | This is a `Writer` which gives useful methods for writing and formatting data  |
| InputStreamReader | This is a `Reader` which takes an `InputStream` (e.g. FileInputStream, ObjectInputStream) |
| OutputStreamWriter | This is a `Writer` which takes an `OutputStream` (e.g. FileOutputStream) |

### üü° Common Stream Operations
* Streams should be closed via `close()` method to prevent resouce leaks and the program deadlocking. You can also use the try-with-resources syntax to do this automaticallyüí°
* You should use the `flush()` method to ensure all data is written to disk when writing data with `OutputStream`
* Only some streams support marking and resetting. Check that it is supported using `boolean markSupported()` otherwise you can encounter an UnsupportedOperationException‚ö†Ô∏è
<hr>

## üü• 8.3 Working With Streams

### üü° FileInputStream and FileOutputStream Classes
* These are LOW LEVEL `InputStream`/`OutputStream` classes which read/write binary data to files
```java
try (InputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(new File("data.txt")) {
	int b;
	while((b=fileInputStream()) != -1) {
		System.out.print((char)b);
	}
}
```

#### üü¢ BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream Classes
* This are HIGH LEVEL InputStream/OutputStream classes which take in low level FileInputStream/FileOutputStream classes!
```java
BufferedInputStream bufferedInputStream
	= new BufferedInputStream(
		new FileInputStream(
			new File(alphabetFile)));
int b;
while ((b=bufferedInputStream.read()) != -1) {
	System.out.println((char)b);
}
```

### üü° FileReader and FileWriter Classes
* These classes offer AUTOMATIC CHARACTER ENCODINGüí°
* These are LOW LEVEL `Reader`/`Writer` classes which read and write String data
* We have a `int read()` method for the reader ,and a `void write(String)` method for the writer
```java
FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(alphabetFile);
int b;
while((b=fileReader.read()) != -1) {
	System.out.println((char)b);
}
```

#### üü¢ BufferedReader and BufferedWriter
* These classes are HIGH LEVEL wrappers, there is also a `ReadLine()` method which is useful!
```java
try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(alphabetFile));
	 BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(alphabetFile));) {
	writer.write("abcd\nefghi");
	String line;
	while((line=reader.readLine())!=null) {
		System.out.println(line);
	}
}
```

### üü° ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream Classes
* These classes allow for SERIALIZATION and DESERIALIZATION of Java objects:
* The ObjectInputStream takes in an InputStream in the form of a FileInputStream or BufferedInputStream
```java
ObjectOutputStream writer = new ObjectOutputStream(
	new FileOutputStream(outputFile));
writer.writeObject("hello world");

ObjectInputStream reader = new ObjectInputStream(
	new FleInputStream(outputFile));
// reader.read(); // returns -1
reader.readObject(); // hello world is returned
```

#### üü¢ Serializable Interface
* Any abstract, concrete or final class can be marked as serializable
* Attempting to serialize a non-serializable instance will not cause compilation errors but WILL THROW NotSerializableException:
```java
objectOutputStream.writeObject(new NotSerializable()); // THROWS NotSerializableException
```

#### üü¢ How Objects are Created When Deserializing
* Static and `transient` variables are ignored during serialization/deserialization
  * Transient variables will be the default value java gives to the instance type (e.g. null for Strings)
  * Static variables will have the value of the last value it was assigned to in the program
* When an object is deserialized, the constructor of the class is NOT called
  * java will call the first no-argument constructor for the first nonserializable parent class


### üü° PrintStream and PrintWriter Classes
* These classes offer nice methods like `format(String, args)` and `printf(String, args)` which are functionally the same
* PrintStream is an `OutputStream`
* PrintWriter is a `Writer`
<hr>

## üü• 8.4 Interacting With Users

### üü° Old Way: Using Buffered Reader
* System.out returns a `PrintStream`
* System.in returns an `InputStream`.
* We use `InputStreamReader` to capture input from the user:
```java
Reader reader = InputStreamReader(System.in);
System.out.println("Enter a character");
		int input = reader.read();
		System.out.println("You entered: "+(char)input);
```

* BufferedReader enables us to read String terminated by enter key by the user
```java
BufferedReader bufferedReader = 
	new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
System.out.println("Please enter a string:");
String input = bufferedReader.readLine();
System.out.printf("You entered: %s", input);
```

### üü° New Way: Using Console
* The `Console` is a singleton which is accessible using `Sytem.console()`
* There is a risk the console can be null‚ö†Ô∏è
* The console has the `format()`/`printf()` that PrintStream also has
* The console has the following methods:
  * `String readLine()`
  * `char[] readPassword()` - a secure way of reading password without invoking String pool!
  * `PrintWriter writer()` - gives a writer instance for methods like `print()`
* Example program:
```java
Console console = System.console();
console.printf("Hi, %s! Please enter some text:", "shiv");
String input = console.readLine();
console.writer().println("You typed: "+input);
```
