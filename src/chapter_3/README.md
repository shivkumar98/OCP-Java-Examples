## ðŸŸ¦ Summary:

âœ…  We use `generics` when we do not want to specify the type for a class

âœ…  We can define generic interfaces and methods

âœ…  We can specify the bounds for a generic type to restrict what types can be used in place of a generic

* We use `?` to represent an unknown generic type
* We can restrict the generic type be specifying an upper and lower bound.
    * We can specify an upperbound using with the following syntax `? extends type`
    * We can specify a lower bound using the following syntax `? super type`
* These upper and lower bounds yield compiler errors if we attempt to add unrestricted types to our array list.

âœ… The Collection framework consists of four interfaces:

1) `List interface`: an ordered collection which allows duplicates

    - `ArrayList`: standard resizeable list
    - `LinkedList`: fast add/removal of end elements
    - `Vector`: old type

2) `Set interface`: unordered and no duplicates

    - `HashSet`: fast retrieval and unordered
    - `TreeSet`: ordered set

3) `Queue interface`: assumed FIFO

    - `LinkedList': both list and queue, and double-ended
    - `ArrayDeque`: pure double-ended queue

4) `Map interface`: key-value pairs

    - `HashMap`: unordered map
    - `TreeMap`: ordered map

âœ… The `Comparable interface` is an interface defining the `compareTo()` method. It can be implemented to define a "natural" ordering for a class

- Most classes already have an implementation of `compareTo()`. E.g. strings ordered aphabetically and numbers by size.

- We can can call `Collections.sort()` to apply the natural ordering to a collection type

- We can implement `compareTo()` by ourselves.

    - If we want an object to come before the argument, then return should be `<0`. 
    - If we want an object is the same as the argument, then the return should `=0`
    - If we want an object to come after the argument, then the return should be `>0`

âœ… The `Comparator interface` is a class which defines a `compare()` method. We can use this to create an "artificial" ordering inside a method rather than a class!

## ðŸŸ¦ Introductions:

- The only collections datatype we have seen so far is the **ArrayList**, this chapter will focus on the other data structures of the collections framework for **lists, maps, sets and queues.**

- We will see how to create classes using **generics**

- We will learn how to implement searching and sorting using **Comparable** and **Comparator**

- We will see some methods which use functional interfaces.

### Exam Topics:

1) Generics and Collections

- Create and use a generic class

- Create and use ArrayList, TreeSet, TreeMap and ArrayDeque objects

- Use java.util.Comparator and java.lang.Comparable interfaces

- Iterate using forEach methods on lists and streams

2) Advanced Java Class Design

- Create and use Lambda expressions

3) Generics and Collections

- Filter a collection using lambda expressions

4) Java Stream API

- Use of merge() and flatMap() methods of the Stream API
