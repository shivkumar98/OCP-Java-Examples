## Chapter 3: Generics and Collections

## Contents:

 3.1: Reviewing OCA Collections

## Introductions:

- The only collections datatype we have seen so far is the **ArrayList**, this chapter will focus on the other data structures of the collections framework for **lists, maps, sets and queues.**

- We will see how to create classes using **generics**

- We will learn how to implement searching and sorting using **Comparable** and **Comparator**

- We will see some methods which use functional interfaces.

### Exam Topics:

- Use java.util.Comparator and java.lang.Comparable interfaces

- Iterate using forEach methods on lists and streams

2) Advanced Java Class Design
