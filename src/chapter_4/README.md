## 🟦 Exam Objectives:

* Generics and Collections:

    - Collections Steams and Filters
    - Iterate using forEach methods on Streams and List
    - Describe Stream interface and Stream pipeline
    - Use method references with Streams

* Lambda Built-In Functional Interfaces

    - Use the built-in interfaces in `java.util.function` such as `Predicate`, `Consumer`, `Function` and `Supplier`
    - Develop code which uses primitive versions of functional interfaces
    - Develop code which uses binary version of functional interfaces.
    - Develop code that uses the `UnaryOperator` interface

* Java Stream API:

    - Develop code to extract data from an object using `peek()` and `map()` methods including the primitive versions of `map()`
    - Search for data by using search methods in Streams such as `findFirst`, `findAny`, `anyMatch`, `allMatch`, and `noneMatch`
    - Develop code which uses the `Optional` class
    - Develop code which uses Stream data and calculation methods
    - Sort a collection using Stream API
    - Save results to a collection using the collect method
    - Use `merge()` and `flat()` methods of Stream API
