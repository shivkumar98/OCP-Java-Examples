## üü® Question 1 üü®
‚ùì What is the output of the following code? ‚ùì
```java
Path path = Paths.get("/user/.././root", "../kodiacbear.txt");
path.normalize().relativize("/lion");
System.out.println(path);
```
* A. `/user/.././root/../kodiacbear.txt`
* B. `/user/./root/kodiacbear.txt/lion`
* C. `/kodiacbear.txt`
* D. `kodiacbear.txt`
* E. `../lion`
* F. The code does not compile


### My answer:
* /user/.././root is equivalent to /root
* so path is `/kodiacbear.txt` when normalised
* I think it is E
* **E**

<br>

## üü® Question 2 üü®
‚ùì For which values of Path inserted on the blank line would it be possible for the following code to output `Success` (Choose all that apply)‚ùì
```java
Path path = ____________;
if(Files.isDirectory(path))
    System.out.println(Files.deleteIfExists(path) ? "Success": "Try Again");
```
* A. `path` refers to a regular file in the file system
* B. `path` refers to a symbolic link in the file system
* C. `path` regers to an empty directory in the file system
* D. `path` refers to a directory with content in the file system
* E. `path` does not refer to a record that exists within the file system
* F. The code does not compile

### My answer:
* I don't believe the code compiles because `Files.deleteIfExists(Path)` has a void return type
* **F**
<hr>


## üü® Question 3 üü®
‚ùì What is the result of the following code (Choose all that apply)  ‚ùì
```java
1: Path path = Paths.get("sloth.schedule");
2: BasicFileAttributes attributes = Files.readAttributes(path, BasicFileAttributes.class);
3: if(attributes.size()>0 && attributes.creationTime().toMillis()>0) {
4:     attributes.setTimes(null,null,null);
5: }
```
* A. It compiles and runs without issue
* B. The code will not compile because of line 2
* C. The code will not compile because of line 3
* D. The code will not compile because of line 4
* E. The code compiles but throws an exception at runtime


### My answer:
* I believe the method on line 2 obtains a read only view of the attributes
* I'm not sure what occurs when attempting to set attributes, but I believe it would be fine
* **A** 
<hr>

## üü® Question 4 üü®
‚ùì If the current work directory is `/user/home`, then what is the output of the following code ‚ùì
```java
Path path = Paths.get("/zoo/animals/bear/koala/food.txt");
System.out.println(path.subpath(1,3).getName(1).toAbsolutePath());
```
* A. `animals/bear`
* B. `koala`
* C. `/user/home/bear`
* D. `/user/home/koala/koala`
* E. `/user/home/food.txt`
* F. `/user/home/koala/food.txt`
* G. The code does not compile

### My answer:
* path.subpath(1,3) will start at index 1 and finish at index 2: `/animals/bear`
* getName(1) will return `/animals` i THINK
* I am completely guessing its A
* **A**
<hr> 


## üü® Question 5 üü®
‚ùì Assuming `/kang` exists as a symbolic link to the directory `/mammal/kangaroo` within the file system. Which of the following statements are correct about thhis code snippet? (Choose all thhat apply)‚ùì
```java
Path path = Paths.get("/kang");
if(Files.isDirectory(path) && Files.isSymbolicLink(path))
    Files.createDirectory(path.resolve("joey"));
```
* A. A new directory will always be created
* B. A new directory will be created only if `/mammal/kangaroo` exists
* C. If the code creates a directory, it will be reachable at `/kang/joey`
* D. If the code creates a directory, it will be reachable at `/mammal/kangaroo/joey`
* E. The code does not compile
* F. The code will compile but always throws an exception at runtime


### My answer:
* Files.isDirectory(path) is true if the symbolic link points to a directory in the file system
* Given that is true, the condition is true, so a directory is created
* A - false, B - true
* Whether C or D is true is what I am unsure of
* D is true I think
* E and F are false
* **B,D**
<br>

<hr>


## üü® Question 6 üü®
‚ùì Given thhat `/animals` is a directory that exists and it is empty, what is the result of the following code? ‚ùì
```java
Path path = Paths.get("/animals");
boolean myBoolean = Files.walk(path)
    .filter((p,a) -> a.isDirectory() && !path.equals(p)) // w1
    .findFirst().isPresent(); // w2
System.out.println(myBoolean ? "No Sub-directory": "Has Sub-directory");
```
* A. It prints `No Sub-directory`
* B. It prints `Sub-directory`
* C. The code will not compile because of line `w1`
* D. The code will not compile because of line `w2`
* E. The output cannot be determined.
* F. It produces an infinite loop at runtime

### My answer:
* The code does not compile because of line w1. A bi-predicate cannot be applied to a Stream
* **C**
<hr>


## üü® Question 7 üü®
‚ùì In the current directory is `\zoo`, and the path `\zoo\turkey` does not exist, then what is the result of executing the following code? (Choose all that apply) ‚ùì
```java
Path path = Paths.get("turkey");
if(Files.isSameFile(path,Paths.get("/zoo/turkey"))) // x1
    Files.createDirectory(path.resolve("info")); // x2
```
* A. The code compiles and runs withhout issue, but it does not create any directories
* B. The directory `/zoo/turkey` is created
* C. The directory `/zoo/turkey/info` is created
* D. The code will not compile because of line x1
* E. The code will not compile because of line x2
* F. It compiles but throws an exception at runtime


### My answer:
* The only reason why I'd think this would not compile is that IOException is not being handled but the exception might be swallowed else where
* x1 and x2 do compil
* If the current directory is `\zoo` and a relative path is give, then the condition IS true
* So a directory will be created
* C SEEMS right
* **C**
<hr>


## üü® Question 8 üü®
‚ùì What is the output of the following code? ‚ùì
```java
Path path1 = Paths.get("/pets/../cat.txt");
Path path2 = Paths.get(".dog.txt");
System.out.println(path1.resolve(path2));
System.out.println(path2.resolve(path1));
```
* A. `/pets/../cat.txt/./dog.txt    /pets/../cat.txt`
* B. `/pets/../cat.txt    ./dogs.txt/pets/../cat.txt`
* C. `/cats.txt    /dog.txt`
* D. `/cats.txt/dog.txt    /cat.txt`
* E. It compiles but throws an exception at runtime

### My answer:
* path2 is a relative path
* So I think an exception is thrown at runtime!
* **E**
<br>

<hr>



## üü® Question 9 üü®
‚ùì What are the advantages of using Files.lines() over Files.readAllLines()? (choose all that apply) ‚ùì
* A. It is often faster
* B. It can be run on large files with very little memory available
* C. It can be chained withh stream methods directly
* D. It does not modify the contents of a file
* E. It ensures the file is not read-locked by the file system
* F. There are no differences, because one method is a pointer to the other.

### My answer:
* F is false
* D - false, neither can write to the file
* A - this COULD be true as streams are efficient
* B - true
* C - true
* E - false
* **A,B,C**
<hr>

## üü® Question 10 üü®

```java
File.move(Paths.get("monkey.txt"), Paths.get("/animals"),
    StandardCopyOption.ATOMIC_MOVE,
    LinkOption.NO_FOLLOWLINKS);
```
* A. If `/animals` exists, it will be overwritten at runtime
* B. If `monkey.txt` is a symbolic link, the file it points to will be moved at runtime
* C. If another process is monitoring the file system, it will not see an incomplete file at runtime
* D. The code will always throw an exception, since no filename is specified in the target folder path
* E. The metadata of the `monkey.txt` will be moved along with the file

### My answer:
* A - false, the replace existing option is not specified
* B - true, I THINK
* C - true
* D - false, I THINK
* E - false
* **B,C**
<br>

<hr>

A. The compiler will throw an excepiton if certain classes are marked `Serializable` <br>
B. Only final classes can be marked `Serializable` <br>

## üü® Question 23 üü®
‚ùì Assume that you have an `InputSream` whose next bytes are `XYZABC`. What is the result of calling the following method on the stream, using a `count` value of 3 ‚ùì

    is.reset();
    is.skip(1);
    sb.append((char)is.read());
    return sb.toString();
}
```

A. It will return a String value of `XYZ` <br>
B. It will return a String value of `XYZA` <br>
C. It will return a String value of `XYZX` <br>
D. It will return a String value of `XYZB` <br>
E. It will return a String value of `XYZY` <br>
F. The code does not compile <br>
G. The code compiles but throws an exception at runtime <br>
H. The result cannot be determined with the information given <br>
‚ùì

### My answer:
* it marks 3 bytes ahead
* It then appends `XYZ`
* It then resets
* `X` is skipped
* `Y` is appended
* **E**‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå
<br>

* CORRECT ANSWEER: H
* The code did not check if the stream supports mark.
* If it did, then the answer would indeed be E
