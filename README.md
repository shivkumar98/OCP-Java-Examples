# OCP Java Examples

I started preparing for Oracle's Java Programming Exams in 2022.

I created this repo to go through the examples from the official study guide for Java Programmer SE8 II for practice and write notes to supplement my learning

**I passed Oracle's Java Programmer SE8 Exam I (1Z0-808) on the 17th Septemeber 2022 (see certification [here](https://catalog-education.oracle.com/pls/certview/sharebadge?id=EA07F7E87C58656C402C410B4210C568878D18157BE7312F361477BEF21C9D87)).**
